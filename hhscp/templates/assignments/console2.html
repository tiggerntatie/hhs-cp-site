        <p>
            By now you have had some experience with the <a href="{{url_for('site_assignment', short_name='console')}}">
            Python console</a> and have seen how you can use it to test short pieces of Python code. There are a couple
            of more uses for the console that you should see before we move on to writing real programs.
        </p>
        <h3>dir</h3>
        <p>
            The objects that you have created (floating point numbers, integers, strings, lists, etc.) have <em>methods</em>
            &ldquo;attached&rdquo; to them. A method is an operation that applies to that object. For example,
             look at a list object:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> nurseryrhymes = ['hickory', 'dickory', 'dock']
>>> print( dir(nurseryrhymes) )
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__delslice__', '__doc__', '__eq__', 
'__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__getslice__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', 
'__imul__', '__init__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', 
'__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__setslice__', '__sizeof__', 
'__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'append', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']
>>> nurseryrhymes.append('itsy')        # one of the methods is called "append". Let's try it.
>>> print(nurseryrhymes)
['hickory', 'dickory', 'dock', 'itsy']  # We've appended something ('itsy') to the list!
>>> nurseryrhymes.remove('dickory')     # Perhaps "remove" does something too.
>>> print(nurseryrhymes)
['hickory', 'dock', 'itsy']             # now we've removed something ('dickory') from the list</pre>
        <p>
            The command, <code>dir(nurseryrhymes)</code> tells Python to list all of the <em>methods</em> that this object
            (a list in this case) can support. To use a method, type the name of the object, followed by a period
            or decimal point, then the name of the method, followed by a pair of parentheses. If the method needs 
            more information to do its thing, then you need to type that information inside the parentheses. This 
            extra information is called <em>parameters</em> or <em>arguments</em> to the method.
        </p>
        <p>
            The importance of the <code>dir</code> function is that it can be used as a simple source of help about
            the language. Notice that there are many methods that have names beginning with a double underscore 
            character: these are intended for internal use and should not be used by YOU in your programs. The remaining
            methods ('append', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort') are fair game,
            however.
        </p>
        <h3>help</h3>
        <p>
            Ok! So we can use <code>dir</code> to figure out <strong>what</strong> an object can do. How can we figure
            out the meaning or purpose of an unfamiliar method, or what arguments should be typed inside the
            parentheses? Simple: ask for help.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> print(nurseryrhymes)
['hickory', 'dock', 'itsy']
>>> help(nurseryrhymes.index)   # I wonder what the index method does
Help on built-in function index:

index(...)
L.index(value, [start, [stop]]) -> integer -- return first index of value.
Raises ValueError if the value is not present.

>>> print(nurseryrhymes.index('dock'))     # Let's see try out the index method to see how it works.
1
>>> print(nurseryrhymes.index('itsy'))
2
>>> print(nurseryrhymes.index('hickory'))  # Oh! I get it! Index will tell me where in the list a particular item can be found.
0
        </pre>
        <h3>Your turn</h3>
        <p>
            Look at the other objects you have created so far (integers, floating point numbers, etc.). Find out what
            methods they support using the <code>dir</code> method. Which methods are mysterious to you? Do a little
            research to figure out what they do or mean.
        </p>
        <h3>Input and Output</h3>
        <p>
            We've been playing around with the Python console for a while, and you might be wondering how we can 
            make a persistent copy of the commands you have been typing. Before we do that, you need to figure out 
            how to make Python print information to the console and how to make it receive information from you.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have already seen the <code>print()</code> function for sending information to the console. There are 
            a few more things you should know about printing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose you would like to print a message that is generated from the values of several variables. You can
            use the <code>format</code> method of string objects to do it. For example:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> a = 99  # this song starts with 99
>>> print ("{0} bottles on the wall, {0} bottles. Take one down, pass it around, {1} bottles left.".format(a, a-1))
99 bottles on the wall, 99 bottles. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles left.
>>> a = 53  # we've taken a lot of bottles down...
>>> print ("{0} bottles on the wall, {0} bottles. Take one down, pass it around, {1} bottles left.".format(a, a-1))
53 bottles on the wall, 53 bottles. Take one down, pass it around, 52 bottles left.</pre>
        <p>
            The special method is tacked on at the end of the string. There are two arguments inside parentheses.
            The first argument is substituted where the {0} appears in the string and the second substitutes the
            {1}. Actually, it would have been convenient to do this by entering the original string only once:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> s = "{0} bottles on the wall, {0} bottles. Take one down, pass it around, {1} bottles left."
>>> a = 99
>>> print(s.format(a,a-1))
99 bottles on the wall, 99 bottles. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles left.
>>> a = 53
>>> print(s.format(a,a-1))
53 bottles on the wall, 53 bottles. Take one down, pass it around, 52 bottles left.</pre>
        <p>
            When we start writing real Python programs we'll need a way for the user to enter information using the
            keyboard. The function for accepting text <em>in</em> to your program is called <code>input()</code>. 
            Let's try using it for inputting a number for our bottle song:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> a = input("Please enter the number of botles:")
Please enter the number of botles:85
>>> print(a)
85
>>> print(s.format(a, a-1))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py", line 2883, in run_code
    exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
  File "&lt;ipython-input-1-1f4a9da6189d&gt;", line 1, in <module>
    print(s.format(a, a-1))
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'</pre>
        <p>
            Uh oh: our first execution error. What's wrong? The program stopped and waited for the user to type
            the number (85) and assigned it to the variable <code>a</code>. Then the program correctly printed 
            the value of <code>a</code> as 85. But when we tried to use <code>a</code> and <code>a-1</code> to 
            format the bottle lyric, Python threw an error. The problem here is that the <code>input()</code> 
            function makes no assumptions about what type of information you <em>intended</em> to enter. It doesn't
            know that you <em>intende</em> to enter a number. Rather, Python assumes that everything you enter
            is a string. So, in this case, a refers to a string object that is equal to the string "85" and not 
            the number 85. When we try to calculate <code>a-1</code> Python doesn't know how to subtract the number
            1 from a string and it returns the error instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to handle the input <em>as an integer</em> we will have to explicitly convert the output
            of the <code>input()</code> function by wrapping it in the <code>int()</code> function:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> a = int(input("Please enter the number of bottles:"))
Please enter the number of bottles:85
>>> print(a)
85
>>> print(s.format(a, a-1))
85 bottles on the wall, 85 bottles. Take one down, pass it around, 84 bottles left.</pre>
        <p>
            If you don't plan to do any math on the input data, then you don't have to worry about 
            converting it:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> name = input("Please tell me your first name:")
Please tell me your first name:Eric
>>> print(name)
Eric
>>> print ("What the heck is {0} doing over there?".format(name))
What the heck is Eric doing over there?</pre>
        <p>
            Another example of converting to a numeric object:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> pi = input("Please enter the value of pi:")
Please enter the value of pi:3.141592654
>>> print (2*pi)  # careful.. Python thinks pi is a string!
3.1415926543.141592654
>>> pi = float(pi)  # convert pi (the string) to a floating point number, using the float function
>>> print (2*pi) # this should give us a proper number
6.283185308
>>> print("An approximate value of pi is {0:.2}!".format(pi)) # print with two sig figs
An approximate value of pi is 3.1!
>>> print("An approximate value of pi is {0:.2}!".format(pi*1000))
An approximate value of pi is 3.1e+03!</pre>

        <h3>Time for a REAL Program</h3>

        <p>
            Typing commands in the console is all well and good, but what if we could have Python remember
            a sequence of commands and replay them at any time in the future? That is what a program does.
            In order to write a short program in Python using Eclipse you have to start with an Eclipse
            project:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the PyDev perspective is active</li>
            <li>Navigate to <code>File/New/PyDev Project</code></li>
            <li>Choose a name for your project. For example: <em>Computer Programming Assignments</em></li>
            <li>Select Grammar 3.0</li>
            <li>Select Python 3 as the project type.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With the project created, you will need to create a new Python module (or source code) file:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click/select your project in the left hand pane</li>
            <li>Navigate to <code>File/New/PyDev Module</code></li>
            <li>Leave the "Package" edit box empty</li>
            <li>Enter a "Name" for your module. The exact name doesn't matter, but as a general rule
            <strong>module names must not begin with a number and must not have any spaces or punctuation marks
            in them. Also, you should avoid upper case characters</strong>.</li>
            <li>Choose &lt;empty&gt; as your module template. Click "OK".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To start with, your Python module/file will have very little in it. By default, Eclipse will add a 
            comment (a string, actually) with the date the file was created and the name of the person (you) who 
            created it. You
            don't absolutely need this comment in your file, but it will do you no harm to leave it there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, instead of typing your Python commands in the console window at the bottom, you can type them
            in the Eclipse source file edit window (the BIG window in the middle of Eclipse. For example,
            you could immortalize some commands about bottles..
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">'''

print(s.format(a, a-1))
a = 98  # Now say it with a few different numbers to start with

        <p>
            To run your program click on your Python module/file in the project window (left side) then click
            the "Play" or "Debug" buttons on the toolbar. Select "Python Run", then "OK".
            This will open a console window at the bottom of the screen where
            you can watch the output and enter your responses. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>99 bottles on the wall. 99 bottles. Take one down, now there are only 98 bottles left
98 bottles on the wall. 98 bottles. Take one down, now there are only 97 bottles left
97 bottles on the wall. 97 bottles. Take one down, now there are only 96 bottles left
Please tell me your first name: Eric
Hello, Eric. You are looking quite frisky today!
Good bye!</pre>
