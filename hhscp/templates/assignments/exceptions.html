        <h3>Exceptions, or When Programs Go Bad</h3>
        <p>
            If you tried running the example at the end of 
            <a href="{{url_for('site_assignment', short_name='classintro')}}">Introduction to Classes</a>, or while
            developing your solution to <a href="{{url_for('site_assignment', short_name='c05areas')}}">Calculating Areas</a>
            or <a href="{{url_for('site_assignment', short_name='c08classdict')}}">Calculating Areas with Class</a>
            you may have noticed that the program did not respond well if the user types the wrong thing at the wrong
            time. For example, in the Introduction to Classes example, if you type "belch" instead of a number for 
            the circle radius, the program fails with an ugly error:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">Find area of a circle, sector or semicircle (or none)? circle
Please enter the circle radius: belch
Traceback (most recent call last):

        <p>
            You should always strive to make your programs <em>robust</em>. This means that the program does not crash, 
            even in the face of wildly unexpected input from sensors or users. So how to accomplish this?
        </p>
        <h3>What is an Error, Exactly</h3>
        <p>
            In programming, there are several types of errors you need to cope with. The most common error that new
            programmers face is the syntax error. Syntax errors are when you have something in your program that
            is simply not legal Python. Syntax errors are normally detected as soon as you attempt to run your program,
            when the Python interpreter tries to understand what you want. If it can't make sense of your program at all,
            then you will probably receive a syntax error.
        </p>
        <p>
            A second type of error happens when your program simply doesn't do what you intended. This is a design 
            or functional error. Your program might be perfectly legal and valid Python, but it just isn't written 
            in a way that accomplishes what you set out to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            A third type of error is a run-time error that occurs when Python is unable to continue because of an 
            unexpected situation. For example, if your program is trying to read from a file that is being deleted
            by another user, or if your user enters something that your program can't interpret.
        </p>
        <p>
            The example above fails with a <code>ValueError</code> because the program attempts to convert
            <em>whatever junk the
            user types</em> to a valid floating point number. Obviously, "belch" does not have an integer or floating point
            numerical equivalent, so Python throws up its hands and surrenders with a run-time error (look to the 
            last line of these error statements to figure out where to look in your codee).
        </p>
        <p>
            This error was so severe that it actually halted the program. If you wanted this program to <em>never
            crash</em>, then you would have to find a graceful way of handling it. In Python, this method is the 
            <code>try except</code> block. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To illustrate how it works, the original example program has been reproduced below with exception
            handling code in place. Try it!

        <pre><code>Find area of a circle, sector or semicircle (or none)? circle
Please enter the circle radius: belch
I'm sorry: you did not enter a valid number.
The area is 3.14159.
Find area of a circle, sector or semicircle (or none)? </code></pre>
        <h3>How it Works</h3>
        <p>
            If you have some code that is <em>liable</em> to result in a run-time error, you should consider putting 
            it inside a <code>try</code> block. If the "dangerous" code results in a run-time error, no more code is
            executed <em>inside</em> the try block. Instead, code begins executing inside the <code>except</code>
            block. The <code>except</code> block is <em>only</em> executed if a run-time error occurs in the <code>try</code>
            block; it can be used to print an error statement or advise the user in how he/she might avoid 
            problems in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>except</code> block names the type of exception that it will handle. There are many different
            types of exceptions and each of the possible types can be handled by a separate <code>except</code> block.
            This example only handles the ValueError exception type. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If your exception handler's only purpose is to print a useful message, and you plan to have the exception
            "caught" and handled at a higher level, then you can reassert the original error by using the
            <code>raise</code> statement inside your exception handler.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a very handy feature because you don't have to give any thought to looking at the user's input
            data and deciding whether it represents a valid floating point number. You just go ahead and convert it
            inside a try block and express your disappointment over any failures inside the except block.
        </p>
