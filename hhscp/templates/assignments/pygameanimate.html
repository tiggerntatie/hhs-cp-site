        <h3>Animating Pygame</h3>
        <p>
            At a basic level, animating graphics on a computer screen is no different from viewing a movie: the 
            perception of motion is created by displaying a series of still pictures in which objects move from 
            frame to frame. In the examples that follow we will develop this idea beginning with a simple example.
            Ultimately, we want to <em>encapsulate</em> or <em>hide</em> some of the ugly details so that we can
            just say something like, &ldquo;put a circle here and make it start moving.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            So let's start with the first example. You should copy it into PyCharm and try running it first:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">import pygame
from pygame.locals import *

pygame.init()
displaysurface = pygame.display.set_mode((400,200))
pygame.display.set_caption('Hello World!')
# some variables to define an oscillating circle
xmin = 100          # minimum x position
xmax = 200          # maximum x position
xpos = float(xmin)  # create a float variable to keep track of where the circle is
xdir = 1            # keep track of what direction it's going (-1 or +1)
speed = 100         # pixels per second
fps = 50            # how many frames per second do we want?
clock = pygame.time.Clock() # make a clock object to manage a frame rate
done = False
while not done: # main game loop
    elapsedms = clock.tick(fps)  # force the program to wait, sufficient to maintain fps frames per second
    # make a circle oscillate back and forth
    if xpos &lt; xmin or xpos > xmax:
        xdir *= -1
    xpos += xdir * speed * elapsedms / 1000.0  # move the x position - speed (px/sec) * time (msec) / 1000 (msec per sec)

    displaysurface.fill((0,0,0))  # erase the entire display surface
    pygame.draw.circle(displaysurface, pygame.Color('white'), (int(xpos),100), 35, 1) # draw a white circle
    pygame.display.update()  # refresh the display screen (display what we have done)
    # check for events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == QUIT:
            done = True
        else:
            print event  # see the variety of events that pygame knows about</pre>
        <p>
            Let's look at some of the things that might be new here:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The program begins by creating some variables that will define the behavior of the program.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">clock = pygame.time.Clock()</code> creates a clock object that
                we can use to control how many frames per second will be displayed by the program. The frame rate
                is controlled a few lines lower down with <code class="prettyprint lang-py">elapsedms = clock.tick(fps)</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Most of the action happens inside the <code class="prettyprint lang-py">while not done:</code> loop. 
                Each time Python runs through this loop, the display will update with a new image that shows a circle
                in a different position. The horizontal position of the circle in each frame is calculated by: 
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">xpos += xdir * speed * elapsedms / 1000.0</code> The elapsedms 
                variable refers to the number of milliseconds that have passed since the <em>last</em> time through
                the loop. The math on this line bumps the xpos variable up (or down) with each passage through the
                loop.
            </li>
            <li>
                The final piece of the program that does the heavy lifting is <code class="prettypring lang-py">
                pygame.draw.circle(displaysurface, pygame.Color('white'), (int(xpos),100), 35, 1) </code> This code
                draws a new circle at a position that is different each time: <code>(int(xpos),100)</code>. The reason
                the screen doesn't fill up with hundreds of circles is that in the preceding line,
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">displaysurface.fill((0,0,0))</code> the entire display surface is
                filled with black (which is the same thing as &ldquo;erasing&rdquo; the screen).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Your Turn</h3>
        <p>
            This might seem like a lot of code to make a circle dance around a screen, and you're right. Before
            continuing with the tutorial, you might want to play around with this program to see if you can make
            the circle oscillate in a different direction (up and down? diagonally?). 
        </p>
        <h3>Simplify</h3>
        <p>
            As we move forward, there is a lot of &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; code that we have to include just to get
            the Pygame program up and running. The next code example shows a possible method for wrapping all of that
            code up into a Python class called PygameApp:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">import pygame

        <p>
            As usual, try this out in PyCharm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wait.. this was supposed to be a simplification, but it's <em>longer!</em> Overall, the program has 
            gotten longer, but the complexity has been segregated into a generic reusable part (PygameApp) and a 
            customized part (MyApp). Let's look at what's going on here:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There are two classes defined here: PygameApp and MyApp. PygameApp attempts to define all of the 
                boring stuff associated with writing a graphics program. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The PygameApp <code>__init__</code> method calls
                the <code>pygame.init()</code> method and creates the time keeping object with
                <code>pygame.time.Clock()</code>. Finally, it handles options that would make it possible to run
                the program in fullscreen mode.
            </li>
            <li>
                The PygameApp <code>run</code> method runs a loop with 
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">while running:</code> which handles looking for the QUIT event
                and calls <code class="prettyprint lang-py">pygame.display.update()</code>. Notice that there is
                also a call to <code class="prettyprint lang-py">self.poll()</code>, which will be a placeholder
                for any class that is built on top of PygameApp. The loop will also call the 
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">self.handle_event(event)</code> method with any events that occur.
            </li>
            <li>
                The remaining methods defined in PygameApp: <code>quit</code>, <code>handle_event</code> and
                <code>poll</code> are placeholders that can be overridden in classes that are built on top of 
                PygameApp.
            </li>        
        </ul>
        <p>
            Now scroll down a bit to the definition of MyApp, where all the useful things happen:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">class MyApp(PygameApp):</code> begins the definition of a new class
                called MyApp that includes all of the functionality already defined in PygameApp.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>__init__</code> method of MyApp sets the same variables that were used in the previous
                example, with the exception that each is prefaced by <code>self.</code> which makes them available
                to every method defined in MyApp. The method also begins by calling the base class initializer:
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">super(MyApp,self).__init__(screensize = screensize)</code> which
                guarantees that any code in the base class (PygameApp) initializer is also executed by MyApp.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>poll</code> method overrides the method with the same name in PygameApp. The first line
                executes the code from the base class: <code class="prettyprint lang-py">super(MyApp,self).poll()</code>
                then implements the same position update and display code that was in the previous example (with some
                minor adjustments).
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally: the entire program is executed in the last two lines of the file!
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">myapp = MyApp((400,200))</code> creates a new object from the MyApp
                class definition and <code class="prettyprint lang-py">myapp.run()</code> executes it. That's all!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Warning: BIG IDEA</h3>
        <p>
            This strategy of breaking a program into a generic reusable part, and a customizable application is one
            way of simplifying the process of writing big programs: find all the parts that are potentially
            reusable and make them into classes of their own. You can even put them in files of their own and
            <code>import</code> them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next tutorial will present an object-oriented encapsulation of display objects and Pygame's method
            for managing and displaying them.
        </p>
