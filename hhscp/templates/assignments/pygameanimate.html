        <h3>Animating Pygame</h3>
        <p>
            At a basic level, animating graphics on a computer screen is no different from viewing a movie: the 
            perception of motion is created by displaying a series of still pictures in which objects move from 
            frame to frame. In the examples that follow we will develop this idea beginning with a simple example.
            Ultimately, we want to <em>encapsulate</em> or <em>hide</em> some of the ugly details so that we can
            just say something like, &ldquo;put a circle here and make it start moving.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            So let's start with the first example. You should copy it into Eclipse and try running it first:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">{{ builtins.open("./hhscp/static/exemplars/pygameanimate1.py").read() }}</pre>
        
        <p>
        	You can download this from <a href="{{url_for('static', filename='exemplars/pygameanimate1.py')}}" download>pygameanimate1.py</a>
        </p>    
        <p>
        	When you execute this, a dialog should pop up that looks something like this:
       	</p>
       	<div><img src="{{url_for('static', filename='pygameanimate1.png')}}" /></div>
        <p>

        <p>
            Let's look at some of the things that might be new here:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The program begins by creating some variables that will define the behavior of the program. These
                include variables for the size of the screen, radius of a circle and the limits of its motion on 
                the screen.
            </li>
            <li>
            	Next are some familiar lines for initializing Pygame and creating a diaplay window.
            	<code class="prettyprint lang-py">clock = pygame.time.Clock()</code> creates a clock object that
                we can use to control how many frames per second will be displayed by the program. The frame rate
                is maintained a few lines lower down with <code class="prettyprint lang-py">elapsedms = clock.tick(fps)</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Most of the action happens inside the <code class="prettyprint lang-py">while not done:</code> loop. 
                Each time Python runs through this loop, the display will update with a new image that shows a circle
                in a different position. The horizontal and vertical position are contained in a single list 
                (<code>position</code>). The velocity is handled in a similar way. With each pass through the loop
                the code checks to see if the position is outside the MAX/MIN variables, and multiplies the appropriate
                part of the velocity by -1 (which is an easy way to reverse direction) if it is.
            </li>
            <li>
                The final piece of the program that does the heavy lifting is <code class="prettypring lang-py">
                pygame.draw.circle(displaysurface, WHITE, [int(x) for x in position], RADIUS, LINEWIDTH) </code> 
                This code
                draws a new circle at a position that is different each time because <code>position</code> is
                being updated with each turn through the loop. The reason
                the screen doesn't fill up with hundreds of circles is that in the preceding line,
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">displaysurface.fill(BLACK)</code> the entire display surface is
                filled with black (which is the same thing as &ldquo;erasing&rdquo; the screen).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Your Turn</h3>
        <p>
            This might seem like a lot of code to make a circle dance around a screen, and you're right. Before
            continuing with the tutorial, you should play around with this program to see if you can make
            the circle move in a different way. Can you change its velocity? Can you give it a vertical acceleration?
            Can you change the size? Shape?  
        </p>
        <h3>Simplify</h3>
        <p>
            As we move forward, there is a lot of &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; code that we have to include just to get
            the Pygame program up and running. The next code example shows a possible method for wrapping all of that
            code up into a Python class called PygameApp:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">{{ builtins.open("./hhscp/static/exemplars/pygameanimate2.py").read() }}</pre>
        
        <p>
        	You can download this from <a href="{{url_for('static', filename='exemplars/pygameanimate2.py')}}" download>pygameanimate2.py</a>
            As usual, try this out in Eclipse.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wait.. this was supposed to be a simplification, but it's <em>longer!</em> Overall, the program has 
            gotten longer, but the complexity has been segregated into a generic reusable part (PygameApp) and a 
            customized part (MyApp). Let's look at what's going on here:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There are two classes defined here: PygameApp and MyApp. PygameApp attempts to define all of the 
                boring stuff associated with writing a graphics program. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The PygameApp <code>__init__</code> method calls
                the <code>pygame.init()</code> method and creates the time keeping object with
                <code>pygame.time.Clock()</code>. Finally, it handles options that would make it possible to run
                the program in fullscreen mode. Handy stuff.
            </li>
            <li>
                The PygameApp <code>run</code> method runs a loop with 
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">while running:</code> which handles looking for the QUIT event
                and calls <code class="prettyprint lang-py">pygame.display.update()</code>. Notice that there is
                also a call to <code class="prettyprint lang-py">self.poll()</code>, which will be a placeholder
                for any class that is built on top of PygameApp. The loop will also call the 
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">self.handle_event(event)</code> method with any events that occur.
                If <code>handle_event</code> decides an event warrants closing the application then it must return
                False, in which case the main run loop will exit and the program will finihs.
            </li>
            <li>
                The remaining methods defined in PygameApp: <code>quit</code>, <code>handle_event</code> and
                <code>poll</code> are placeholders that can be overridden in classes that are built on top of 
                PygameApp.
            </li>        
        </ul>
        <p>
            Now scroll down a bit to the definition of MyApp, where all the useful things happen:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">class MyApp(PygameApp):</code> begins the definition of a new class
                called MyApp that includes all of the functionality already defined in PygameApp.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>__init__</code> method of MyApp sets the same variables that were used in the previous
                example, with the exception that each is prefaced by <code>self.</code> which makes them available
                to every method defined in MyApp. The method also begins by calling the base class initializer:
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">super().__init__(screensize = screensize)</code> which
                guarantees that any code in the base class (PygameApp) initializer is also executed by MyApp.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>poll</code> method overrides the method with the same name in PygameApp. The first line
                executes the code from the base class: <code class="prettyprint lang-py">super().poll()</code>
                then implements the same position update and display code that was in the previous example (with some
                minor adjustments).
            </li>
            <li>
            	The event handling code is extended with the overridden <code>handle_event</code> method which is
            	checking for the 'q' key press and printing the contents of the event to the console.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally: the entire program is executed in the last two lines of the file!
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">myapp = MyApp((400,200))</code> creates a new object from the MyApp
                class definition and <code class="prettyprint lang-py">myapp.run()</code> executes it. That's all!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Warning: BIG IDEA</h3>
        <p>
            This strategy of breaking a program into a generic reusable part, and a customizable application is one
            way of simplifying the process of writing big programs: find all the parts that are potentially
            reusable and make them into classes of their own. You can even put them in files of their own and
            <code>import</code> them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next tutorial will present an object-oriented encapsulation of display objects and Pygame's method
            for managing and displaying them.
