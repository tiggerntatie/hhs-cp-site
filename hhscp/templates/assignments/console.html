        <p>
            Once you have Eclipse up and running for the first time, you should create a new project 
            (<code>File/New/PyDev Project</code>). It doesn't matter
            what name you give it at this point, but you might name it something like "test". Your choice.
            You can leave the rest of the settings at their defaults.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the project created, you will need to create a new Python module (or source code) file:
            Select the project in the left hand pane, then select <code>File/New/PyDev Module</code>. 
            In the new module dialog, leave the Package edit window empty, and enter a name for the 
            module in the Name edit window. Again, the exact name doesn't matter (but as a general rule, 
            module names must not begin with a number and must not have any spaces in them). The 
            Template window may have <code>&lt;empty&gt;</code> selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a project and module created, you can access the Python console. If you are using your own 
            personal computer (especially a Mac) you can access the Python console from the system terminal 
            (or from a "DOS Box" on a Windows machine). Since the school computers are configured to not 
            allow students access to terminal, we will have to use the terminal that is built in 
            to Eclipse.
        </p>
        <h3>Accessing the console</h3>
        <p>
            The console is accessible from Eclipse at <code>Window/Show View/Console</code>. This will open
            a console window at the bottom of the Eclipse screen. At the upper right corner of this console
            window you should find the <code>Open Console</code> icon. Click this and select the 
            <code>PyDev Console</code>, then <code>Python console</code> on the window that pops up. 
            Now the console window should display a prompt that looks something like:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> import sys; print('%s %s' % (sys.executable or sys.platform, sys.version))
/usr/bin/python 2.7.1 (r271:86832, Aug  5 2011, 03:30:24)

        <p>
            This is where you will do your typing today. 
        </p>
        <h3>By the numbers</h3>
        <p>
            Start by typing some numbers. Press return or enter when you are done with each number. Try typing numbers
            with and without decimal points. You can even enter complex numbers! Each time you type a number, Python 
            creates an <em>object</em> in the computer's memory that represents the number, then it shows you the value.
            Once Python has shown you the value, it throws the number away and forgets all about it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Your window might look something like this (the number with the <strong>j</strong> is imaginary):
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> 3
Out[3]: 3
>>> 3.
Out[4]: 3.0
>>> 55532235
Out[5]: 55532235
>>> 234234.23423525
Out[6]: 234234.23423525001
>>> 32j
Out[7]: 32j</pre>
        <p>
            If you want to keep your numbers around, you have assign them to variable names using the assignment 
            operator: <strong>=</strong> . This is sort of like using the M+ key on your calculator:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> a = 1
>>> b = 23.5
>>> pi = 3.14159
>>> num77 = 77
>>> a
Out[12]: 1
>>> b
Out[13]: 23.5
>>> pi
Out[14]: 3.1415899999999999</pre>
        <p>
            Notice that floating point numbers often aren't <em>exactly</em> the same as what you entered! Integer
            numbers <em>will</em> be exactly what you entered. Variable names must begin with a letter (upper or
            lower case) and can be as long as you like, and may contain underscore characters or numerals (but not
            as the first character). Since there a lot of variable names that you could imagine, this is like having
            as many M+ keys on a calculator as you want.
        </p>
        <h3>Math (ugh)</h3>
        <p>
            As you might expect, Python can actually <em>do things</em> with those numbers.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> a*b
Out[44]: 23.5
>>> a*b # multiplication
Out[45]: 23.5
>>> a/b # division
Out[46]: 0.042553191489361701
>>> a//b # integer division
Out[47]: 0.0
>>> b//a
Out[48]: 23.0
>>> (3+5)*pi/43.0 # Parentheses are good too
Out[49]: 0.5844818604651163</pre>
        <h3>Strings (text)</h3>
        <p>
            Python isn't just a calculator. You can create text objects on the fly by typing text, enclosed in either
            single ('), double ("), or triple (""" or ''') quotes. These are called <em>strings</em> (for historical)
            reasons, not because they are very stringy):
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> "Python is named after Monty Python"
Out[19]: 'Python is named after Monty Python'
>>> '''This is text enclosed in a triple single quote!'''
Out[20]: 'This is text enclosed in a triple single quote!'
>>> """Triple quoted text can include quotes in it (like this: ") without confusing Pythons"""
Out[21]: 'Triple quoted text can include quotes in it (like this: ") without confusing Pythons'
>>> myname = "Mr. Dennison"
>>> myname
Out[23]: 'Mr. Dennison'</pre>
        <h3>Collections</h3>
        <p>
            One of Python's strengths is that it very good at handling lots of objects at once. One way
            Python lets you do this is by putting objects (like numbers or strings) into <em>lists</em>:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> someevens = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]
>>> somenames = ['Tom', 'Dick', 'Harry']
>>> somelastnames = ['Wilson', 'Smith', 'Jones']</pre>
        <p>
            Once you have a list of things you can pull out individual items from the list, or sections of the list:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> someevens[0]
Out[27]: 2
>>> someevens[5]
Out[28]: 12
>>> someevens[0]  # This retrieves the zeroth (or first) item
Out[29]: 2
>>> someevens[5]  # The sixth item (zeroth is first)
Out[30]: 12
>>> someevens[5:7]  # Sixth up to but not including seventh
Out[31]: [12, 14]
>>> someevens[5:]
Out[32]: [12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
>>> someevens[:7]  # Can you figure out what this does?
Out[33]: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
>>> someevens[7:5:-1]  # how about in reverse?
Out[34]: [16, 14]</pre>
        <p>
            You can change parts of the list too. Remember <code>somelastnames</code>?:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> somelastnames
Out[35]: ['Wilson', 'Smith', 'Jones']
>>> somelastnames[1] = 'Ramalamadingdong'
>>> somelastnames
Out[37]: ['Wilson', 'Ramalamadingdong', 'Jones']</pre>
        <p>
            I can even assign variables to other variables, but it does not make a new copy of the object. Try this:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> morelastnames = somelastnames
>>> print(morelastnames)
['Wilson', 'Ramalamadingdong', 'Jones']
>>> print(somelastnames)
['Wilson', 'Ramalamadingdong', 'Jones']
>>> somelastnames[1] = 'Boring'
>>> print(somelastnames)
['Wilson', 'Boring', 'Jones']
>>> print(morelastnames)
['Wilson', 'Boring', 'Jones']</pre>
        <p>
            I made change to the list object <code>somelastnames</code>, and it changed not only <code>somelastnames</code>,
            it also changed <code>morelastnames</code>! This is because both variables were pointing to the same object.
            So variables are <em>not</em> exactly like the post office box model for computer memory. Different names
            (variables) can quite easily refer to the same object in memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may have noticed that I'm not just typing the variable, I am using a <em>function</em> for printing
            the value of these variables or expressions to the screen. When you start writing programs that produce
            text on the screen, you will have to use the <code>print</code> function too.
        </p>
        <h3>Generating lists and list comprehensions</h3>
        <p>
            Now it's time to make some magic with lists! You can use one list to generate another list. Suppose
            I want to generate a list of odd numbers from my list of even numbers:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> print(someevens)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
>>> someodds = [x+1 for x in someevens]
>>> print(someodds)
[3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21]</pre>
        <p>
            If you need a quick way of generating a list of integers, use the built in range function:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> hundred = range(1,100)
>>> print(hundred)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54,
55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80,
81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]</pre>
        <p>
            You can zip two lists together and make a list of tiny tuples (a tuple is a special kind of list that can't
            be modified):
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> evenodd = zip(someevens, someodds)
>>> print(evenodd)
[(2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7), (8, 9), (10, 11), (12, 13), (14, 15), (16, 17), (18, 19), (20, 21)]</pre>
        <h3>Lambda functions</h3>
        <p>
            If you have a quick mathematical operation that you'd like to repeat with lots of different numbers
            you could make your own function. For example, if I want a quick way to convert degrees Fahrenheit 
            to degrees Celsius:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> celsius = lambda f: (f-32.0)/1.8
>>> print(celsius(32))
0.0
>>> print(celsius(70))
21.1111111111</pre>
        <h3>Putting it together</h3>
        <p>
            Suppose I have a list of numbers that represent temperatures in Fahrenheit, and I would like to make
            a new list of the converted temperatures in Celsius. With my new celsius function and the list generating
            idea:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> f_temperatures = [32.0, 15.5, -55.3, 62, 36.3]
>>> c_temperatures = [celsius(x) for x in f_temperatures]
>>> print(c_temperatures)
[0.0, -9.1666666666666661, -48.5, 16.666666666666668, 2.3888888888888871]</pre>
        <p>
            You could also use a builtin Python function, <code>map</code>, to do a similar thing:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">>>> c = map(celsius, f_temperatures)
>>> print(c)
[0.0, -9.1666666666666661, -48.5, 16.666666666666668, 2.3888888888888871]</pre>
        <h3>Try It!</h3>
        <p>
            Write your own lambda function that does some kind of conversion. Inches to centimeters? Pounds to
            kilograms? Then see if you can convert a list of values like the example above. Can you write a lambda
            function that accepts two arguments? Can you write one that returns two values? You may have to do some
            research to figure it out.
        </p>
