        <h3>Introducing Pygame</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.pygame.org/wiki/about">Pygame</a> is a collection of Python modules that make it
            relatively easy to design games that run on Windows, Mac and Linux computers. The fact that Pygame
            is for gaming is NOT the reason we will be using it in the weeks ahead. Modules that enable gaming
            DO happen to be well adapted to writing graphics-oriented programs, which IS the reason we will be using
            it!
        </p>
        <h3>Installing Pygame</h3>
        <p>
            If you are using one of the lab computers then they have already had Pygame installed on them and
            are &ldquo;ready to go.&rdquo; If you are using your own Windows or Mac computer for classwork, then
            you will probably have to install Pygame yourself. To install Pygame, head on over to the 
            <a href="http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml">download page</a> and grab a copy. Notice that there
            are several versions available, depending on which version of Python you are using. You should be using
            either Python 2.6 or 2.7 on your personal machine (we are using 2.6 on the lab computers).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are installing Pygame to your Linux computer then you should be able to use your distribution's
            package manager to install it. For example, under Ubuntu you could open the terminal application and type:
        </p>
        <pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-pygame</code></pre>
        <p>
            Python is GPL-licensed, open source and completely free for you to download and install on your computer.
        </p>

        <h3>Testing Pygame</h3>
        <p>
            Assuming you have Pygame installed on your computer, you should test the installation by running
            a do-nothing &ldquo;hello, world&rdquo; application:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">import pygame
from pygame.locals import *

pygame.init()
displaysurface = pygame.display.set_mode((600,200))
pygame.display.set_caption('Hello World!')
done = False
while not done: # main game loop
    pygame.display.update()
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == QUIT:
            done = True</pre>
        <p>
            There are a few things in this example that may not be familiar:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The line <code class="prettyprint lang-py">from pygame.locals import *</code> loads some common Pygame constants so that
                you can use them without prefacing them with <code>pygame.</code>. All of the values defined
                in <code class="prettyprint lang-py">pygame.locals</code> are upper-case, so you won't confuse them 
                with your own variables and classes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">pygame.init()</code> <em>must</em> be called before you can use 
                the Pygame library.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">displaysurface = pygame.display.set_mode((600,200))</code> creates
                a graphics window on your screen. The width and height of the window are passed in as a tuple to set_mode.
                Width and height are specified in units of pixels. You can also specify arguments that force the window
                to be full screen. The set_mode function returns a Pygame surface object that will be used to
                represent the writable surface of the graphics window.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">pygame.display.update()</code> refreshes the physical screen.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">for event in pygame.event.get():</code> retrieves a list of 
                event objects that represent things like keypresses, mouse and joystick movements. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This program only creates a graphic window and then listens to events from the user until the window
            is closed (<code class="prettyprint lang-py">if event.type == QUIT</code>). Note that the <code>QUIT</code>
            constant is one of the special upper-case constants loaded from pygame.locals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try copying this code to PyCharm an testing it out.
        </p>
        <h3>Wait.. This Looks a Little Ugly</h3>
        <p>
            Python and Pygame are not a &ldquo;toy&rdquo; tool for developing graphics software. They are a tool with
            considerable depth and flexibility that can be used to develop some surprisingly capable programs. One
            of the tasks that lies ahead of us is figuring out a pattern for using Pygame that we can use in all 
            of our graphics programs. The goal here is to <em>wrap</em> or <em>encapsulate</em> some of Pygame's 
            complexity so that we won't have to worry about <em>all</em> the gory details every time we write a little
            program.
        </p>
        <h3>Hello World, Take Two</h3>
        <p>
            Since the last example was pretty boring, let's add something with a little more interest: colorful 
            geometric shapes. Before we can talk about that we have to talk about colors and coordinates.
        </p>
        <h4>Colors</h4>
        <p>
            In the computer world, colors are often defined as a combination of red, green and blue. The amount
            of each component color is an integer with values between 0 and 255 (the biggest positive integer
            that can be expressed with 8 binary digits). To specify a complete color you just string the three
            integers (red, green and blue) together in a tuple. For example: (60,200,100).
        </p>
        <p>
            Colors may also have a fourth number, called &ldquo;alpha&rdquo;, which says how <em>transparent</em> the
            color is. For example: (60,200,100,25). An alpha value of zero is totally transparent, while a value of
            255 is totally opaque. Values in between are semi-transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although you can use ordinary tuples to define colors in Pygame, Pygame also comes with a Color class
            to help you along. For example: <code>pygame.Color('red')</code> will create a Pygame color object that
            is equivalent to the tuple: (255,0,0). See the Pygame <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/">documentation</a>
            for more information.
        </p>
        <h4>Coordinates</h4>
        <p>
            Graphics objects and images are placed on the Pygame window by specifying coordinates in the window. The
            coordinate system used in Pygame is similar to the Cartesian system that you are familiar with in 
            mathematics. Locations are specified as pairs of integers (in a tuple), where the first number in the
            tuple is the horizontal position and the second number is the vertical position. This would be 
            <em>exactly</em> like the Cartesian system if it weren't for an ancient quirk of graphics hardware: 
            the vertical axis is upside down.
        </p>
        <p>
            The origin of the Pygame window coordinate system is the upper left hand corner of the window, 
            surface or screen. The horizontal axis is positive to the right and negative to the left, while the
            vertical axis is positive <em>going down</em> and negative <em>going up</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's see how this works in our next example (don't forget to run it on your own!):
        </p>
        
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">import pygame
from pygame.locals import *

# Display some simple shapes

pygame.init()
pygame.display.set_caption('Hello World!')
displaysurface = pygame.display.set_mode((400,400))
alphasurface = displaysurface.convert_alpha()

done = False
while not done: # main game loop
    displaysurface.fill((0,0,0))    # clear the display surfaces
    alphasurface.fill((0,0,0,0))    # clear the drawing surface
    pygame.draw.rect(alphasurface, (30,30,30,200), pygame.Rect(20,20,100,40))     # draw a rectangle
    displaysurface.blit(alphasurface,(0,0)) # copy to the window
    alphasurface.fill((0,0,0,0))    # clear the drawing surface
    pygame.draw.circle(alphasurface, (250,20,30,200), (200,200),86) # draw a circle
    displaysurface.blit(alphasurface,(0,0)) # copy to the window
    smallsurf = pygame.Surface((200,200), SRCALPHA)             # create a smaller drawing surface
    pygame.draw.circle(smallsurf, (80,20,90,200), (86,86),86)   # and draw a circle to it
    displaysurface.blit(smallsurf,(200,200))                    # then copy it to the window
    pygame.display.update()         # update tme main window
    pygame.time.wait(10) 
    # check for events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == QUIT:
            done = True
        else:
            print event  # see unhandled events going by</pre>
        <p>
            Let's look at some of the highlights:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">alphasurface = displaysurface.convert_alpha()</code> makes a copy
                of the main window display surface that is capable of handling colors with an alpha (transparency)
                component. By default, Pygame surfaces do <em>not</em> support transparency components.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">displaysurface.fill((0,0,0))</code> fills the main display surface
                with a solid color (like a paintbucket fill in Photoshop). The color shown here has zero for each
                of the color components, which is black. Since black is the absence of all light, all of the 
                components have to be at zero to produce black. <strong>Note:</strong> the call looks like it has
                too many parentheses, right? This is because the argument to the <code>fill</code> method is a color,
                which is a tuple, which is a list of objects inside parentheses.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">alphasurface.fill((0,0,0,0))</code> fills the alphasurface with
                black, <em>but also specifies total transparency</em>. This surface will serve as a transparent
                background to the objects that we will paint on the screen.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">pygame.draw.rect(alphasurface, (30,30,30,200), pygame.Rect(20,20,100,40))</code>
                draws a rectangle (pygame.draw.rect) to the transparent surface (alphasurface) using a dark-gray
                semi-transparent color (30,30,30,200). The last argument to pygame.draw.rect is a new Rect object
                that specifies a rectangular region of the alphasurface. The four arguments to the pygame.Rect
                constructor are the x and y coordinates of the upper left-hand corner of the rectangle, followed
                by the width and height of the rectangle. In this example, the drawn rectangle will have its upper
                left-hand corner start at the (20,20) point, will be 100 pixels wide and 40 pixels high.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">displaysurface.blit(alphasurface, (0,0))</code> copies the 
                transparent drawing surface on to the window surface, such that its upper left hand corner will
                be at (0,0) on the screen.
            </li> 
            <li>
                Most of the remaining lines are similar. The one exception is the line for drawing a circle:
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">pygame.draw.circle(alphasurface, (250,20,30,200), (200,200),86)</code>.
                This example specifies a circle with a semi-transparent reddish color (250,20,30,200), whose
                center is at (200,200) on the transparent drawing surface and has a radius of 86 pixels.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">pygame.time.wait(10)</code> forces your program to wait for 
                10 milliseconds before continuing. This line isn't absolutely necessary, but gives other programs
                running on your computer a chance to run.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Although this example displays a <em>static</em> scene where nothing moves, it is actually drawing and
            erasing the same scene over and over again, as fast as it can (except for the 10 millisecond breather).
            Again, you should copy and run this code on your own and experiment with changing various values.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consult the Pygame documentation and try your hand at drawing other kinds of shapes, such
            as ellipses and polygons.
        </p>
