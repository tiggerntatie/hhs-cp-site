        <h3>A Game of Tic Tac Toe</h3>
        <p>
            This tutorial describes one method for implementing a simple game of Tic
            Tac Toe. If you have played the game before, you may know that the best you
            can hope to do against a skilled player is to not lose (that is, to draw).
            Accordingly, this isn't considered a very serious game, but for our 
            purposes it serves as a good opportunity to learn about
            <a href="{{url_for('site_assignment', short_name='gametreesbasics')}}">game trees</a> and
            recursion.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This tutorial isn't really going to attempt to teach you
            all the ins and outs of game theory or game trees. The point is to
            show you an example of a simple game tree in action. Later you will
            have an opportunity to try your hand at your own game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Tic Tac Toe game listing that follows works in console mode
            only. At some point in the future, we will reuse it as an
            &ldquo;engine&rdquo; in a Pygame version of the same thing. For
            now I want to focus on how the game works, and not how to make it
            look graphically cool.
        </p>
        <h3>
            A Warning!
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is <strong>hard</strong> to wrap your head around someone else's 
            program! This is a big program, with lots of unfamiliar methods
            and Python functions and you should not expect to figure it out
            quickly. I do expect you to use it and poke at it. Look at the 
            methods that do the &ldquo;heavy lifting&rdquo; and spend the time
            necessary to understand each unfamiliar line in them. If you see
            a function name you don't recognize, like <code>reduce</code> or 
            <code>filter</code>, then look them up and understand what they do:
            they are workhorses for effective Python programming!
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, I don't claim that this program is the most elegant or
            efficient example of a game tree-based Tic Tac Toe player. In fact,
            I know it is <em>inefficient</em>. A good game tree pays attention
            to finding and eliminating redundant branches and remembering
            decisions it has already made. The game tree implemented in 
            <em>this</em> example does none of these things for the sake
            of brevity and readability.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Sample Game Output
        </h3>
        <p>
            The following is a snippet from a session playing the Tic Tac Toe
            game:
        </p>
        <pre>Current board position is:
nextplayer: X, score: ~
~~~
~~~
~~~

Your move - enter tuple: e.g. (0,2): (1,1)
Current board position is: 
nextplayer: X, score: ~
~~O
~X~
~~~

Your move - enter tuple: e.g. (0,2): (1,0)
Current board position is: 
nextplayer: X, score: ~
~XO
~X~
~O~

Your move - enter tuple: e.g. (0,2): </pre>
        <p>
            You get to play first, and each time you play the game shows you 
            the current state of the game &ldquo;board&rdquo; after the
            computer goes. You have
            to enter the coordinates of your next play as a tuple. This 
            may be in parentheses or not, as you wish. The (0,0) position
            is in the upper left corner, (2,0) is in the upper right, (2,2)
            in the lower right and (0,2) in the lower left. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After each of your moves, the computer selects its move and
            displays the resulting board. The possible outcomes for each
            game are for one of the two players to win, or a draw.
        </p>
        <h3>The Source</h3>
        <p>
            First let's have a look at the full source code for this example.
            It's a little big, but it's mostly comments. I will talk about 
            several of the features of the program after the listing, but
            refer to the code comments for details.
        </p>
        <p>
            As always, you should copy and paste this example into a new
            Python file using PyCharm and try it out. You can download this as
            a complete file:

        <h4>
            TTTPosition
        </h4>
        <p>
            The class <code>TTTPosition</code> is the only class defined or used
            by the game. Its sole purpose is to represent everything possible
            about a <em>single</em> snapshot of a game. The snapshot includes
            what marks (Xs or Os) have been placed, where they have been placed
            and whose turn is next. The game is started by creating a single
            instance of <code>TTTPosition</code> and calling its 
            <code>playconsole</code> method.
        </p>
        <p>
            The class maintains its internal representation of which spots on 
            the playing &ldquo;board&rdquo; are filled by using a list with
            nine entries. The first three entries represent the first row of the
            board, the second three are the 2nd row and the third set of three
            are the last row.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Class Attribute: <code>threes</code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            There is one attribute of the class, <code>threes</code>, which
            is not defined in terms of <code>self</code>. This attribute is
            held in common by <em>all</em> instances of <code>TTTPosition</code>.
            The attributes lists a bunch of tuples that in turn contain sets of
            three board positions that correspond to all of the different ways
            a player can get three in a row to win the game. The program
            uses this list to check for winning board positions without having
            to write code for every single case. Remember, if you ever find 
            yourself writing the same code more than once, there may be a good
            way to rewrite your program to minimize redundancy.
        </p>
        <h4>
           <code>__init__</code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            The class initializer takes a list of of nine integers as the initial
            state of the board, followed by an integer that represents the next
            or first person to play. The X player is represented always as +1 and
            the O player is represented as -1.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important attribute of the class that is set in 
            <code>__init__</code> is <strong><code>self.nextplayer</code></strong>.
            This represents the identity of the next player expected to move
            from this position.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <code>__repr__</code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            The <em>double</em> underscores around this method tip you off that
            the name is special for Python. In any of your programs you can 
            write code like: <code>print(myvar)</code> and Python usually 
            prints something useful. When you create your own classes, like
            <code>TTTPosition</code>, Python doesn't know how to print something
            useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you write a <code>__repr__</code> method for your class, and 
            use it to return a string, that string will be the one Python
            uses when you try to <code>print</code> the object. This class
            is using the method to print a nicely formatted version of the
            Tic Tac Toe board.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <code>__eq__</code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            This is another special method. The <code>__eq__</code> method 
            is used by Python any time it is asked to see whether one
            object is &ldquo;equal&rdquo; to another. If you want to compare
            objects in this way, then you will have to define this method. My
            implementation of the method just checks to see if the spaces
            on both boards are filled in the same way, and have the same 
            player ready to take the next turn.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <code>_ifromxy</code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            The single underscore for this method is a signal to you and
            other programmers that this method is not expected to be directly
            called by users of the class. It is used internally by other 
            methods of the class. This method is used to translate an (x,y)
            tuple of board coordinates into a single index (from 0 to 8) 
            that will be used to look up a single space of the playing board.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <code>_possiblemoves</code>
        </h4>        
        <p>
            This &ldquo;private&rdquo; method walks through the list of spaces
            on the playing board and finds all the empty ones that could be 
            used for the next move. For each open spot it creates a new instance
            of the <code>TTTPosition</code> class and appends it to a list of 
            next moves that it is building. Finally, it returns the list of
            <code>TTTPosition</code> objects to the caller.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <code>setmove</code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            This method accepts a board position tuple as an argument and returns
            a new <code>TTTPosition</code> object with that position filled by
            <code>nextplayer</code>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <code>checkwin</code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            This method's only responsibility is to inspect the board and report
            whether one player or another has actually won the game. It walks
            through the <code>self.threes</code> attribute, using each entry
            as a template for figuring out which spots on the board constitute
            a three in a row. The heavy lifting for this method is done using
            the <code>reduce</code> function and a lambda function. The reader
            is invited to investigate how that works on his or her own.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <code>getscore</code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            This is the heart of the program! The <code>getscore</code> method
            makes a very simple decision. If the current position is a winning
            position, it returns the winner (+1 or -1). 
        </p>
        <p>
            If it is <em>not</em>
            a winning position then it builds a list of all the possible
            <em>next</em> positions and calls <code>getscore</code> on each 
            of them. Finally, it returns the score from that list of positions
            that is most favorable to the next player.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is cool because each time you call <code>getscore</code> on
            a position, it may end up calling <code>getscore</code> on a bunch
            of other positions, and each of those may call it again for another
            bunch of positions, and so on until all of the possible positions
            have been tested!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you were to make a picture of this process, it would look like
            an upside down tree, with the starting position as the root, at the 
            top, and all of the branches and leaves flowing downward from there.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the current position is not a winning position, and there are
            no more moves to make then the method returns zero, which doesn't
            favor either player. For Tic Tac Toe, this path would represent
            a drawn game.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <code>inputnextmove</code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            This method interacts with the user to get the coordinates of his or
            her desired next move. It first prints the current position of the
            board, then asks for the move, then returns the result of calling
            the <code>setmove</code> method.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <code>autonextmove</code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            This method calls the <code>getscore</code> for the current position,
            then looks at the scores of the next possible moves to find one
            that is most favorable. If more than one move is favorable then it 
            chooses one of those at random. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If there are no favorable positions to choose from, then it will
            pick from one of the &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; positions, and if there
            are none of those, it will pick from a losing option (though
            the writing is on the wall).
        </p>
        <p>
            In any case, <code>autonextmove</code> will return a chosen next
            position. If no more positions are possible, then it will return
            <code>None</code>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <code>playconsole</code>
        </h4>
        <p>
            This last method is just a routine for calling the
            <code>inputnextmove</code> and <code>autonextmove</code> methods
            one after another until the game is over.
        </p>
        <h3>
            The <code>__name__</code> variable
        </h3>
        <p>
            Notice that after the class definition, there are only three lines
            of actual of code that are executed:
        </p>
        <pre class = "prettyprint lang-py">if __name__ == '__main__':
    g = TTTPosition([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],1)
    g.playconsole()</pre>
        <p>
            Every Python module (file or program) is associated with a hidden
            variable called <code>__name__</code>. If you <code>import</code>
            the module, then it is assigned the name of the module.
            If your Python program is executed (as you usually do for these
            exercises) then the <code>__name__</code> variable is set to equal
            <code>'__main__'</code>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Programmers often use this feature to write test code for files
            that they expect to be imported by other files. In the case
            of this Tic Tac Toe game, I planned to import this class,
            <code>TTTPosition</code>, into another program, without having
            the game actually execute. By protecting the code that creates
            an instance of the <code>TTTPosition</code> class inside this test,
            I can be sure it will only be instantiated and &ldquo;played&rdquo;
            if it is executed as a stand-alone program.
