            The purpose of this challenge is to gain proficiency with looping, decision making and lists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Write and submit a Python program that computes and displays the distribution of characters in a given
            sample of text.
        </p>
        <p>
            Output of your program should look like this:
        </p>
        <pre>Please enter a string of text (the bigger the better): <em>The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.</em>
The distribution of characters in "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain." is:
iiiiii
nnnnnn
aaaaa
sss
ttt
ee
hh
ll
pp
yy
m
r

Process finished with exit code 0</pre>

        <p>
            Notice about this example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uppercase characters are converted to lowercase</li>
            <li>Spaces and punctuation marks are ignored completely.</li>
            <li>Characters that are more common appear first in the list.</li>
            <li>Where the same number of characters occur, the lines are ordered alphabetically. For example, in the 
            printout above, the letters e, h, l, p and y both occur twice in the text and they are listed in the
            output in alphabetical order.</li>
            <li>Letters that do not occur in the text are not listed in the output at all.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are a few techniques or tricks that you may find handy when working on this challenge. If you see
            something here that sounds useful, feel free to learn more about it!
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code class="prettyprint lang-py">'a string has several characters'.count('a')</code> will 
            return 5, which is the number of times the character 'a' appears in the string.</li>
            <li><code class="prettyprint lang-py">zip([1,4,2],['a','z','q'])</code> will return
            a list of <em>tuples</em> (another type of list) like this: [(1, 'a'), (4, 'z'), (2, 'q')]</li>
            <li>If <code>mylist</code> is a list like [435, 2, 45, 2]</code> then
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">mylist.sort()</code> will change it to: [2, 2, 45, 435]</li>
            <li>If <code>mylist</code> is a list like [435, 2, 45, 2]</code> then
                <code class="prettyprint lang-py">mylist.append(99)</code> will change it to: [435, 2, 45, 2, 99]</li>
            <li>If <code>mylist</code> is a list like [435, 2, 45, 2]</code> then mylist[-1] will return 2, the last
            element in the list.</li>
            <li>You can get the length of a string, or number of elements in a list using the builtin
            <code class="prettyprint lang-py">len()</code> function. For example:
            <code class="prettyprint lang-py">len([435, 2, 45, 2])</code> will return 4.</li>
            <li>If you <code class="prettyprint lang-py">import string</code> then use
            <code class="prettyprint lang-py">string.letters</code> to get a string with the letters a-z in it.</li>
        </ul>
