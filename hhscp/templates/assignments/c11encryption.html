        <em>Challenge by Jack Boffa, HHS &apos;14</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        In this challenge, you will be writing an implementation of a basic 
        encryption algorithm. Encryption (more broadly known as cryptography) 
        is the process of protecting data by making it readable only by those 
        with the authority to see it. Encryption generally works using keys -- 
        passwords used by the algorithm to jumble the sensitive data in some 
        way. Someone who wants to encrypt a secret message chooses a key, 
        feeding it and the message to the encryption program. The program 
        outputs an unreadable version of the message. Someone who knows the 
        selected key can give it to the program (along with the encrypted 
        message) to get back the original data.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Write and submit a Python program that performs encryption and 
        decryption.</em> This program will work by asking for some text (to be 
        the secret message), a key (the password), and whether the user 
        wants to encrypt or decrypt the given data. The program will then 
        perform the specified action.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will implement a simple algorithm that produces its output by 
        adding together corresponding characters in the message and key. 
        Since there is no way to mathematically add two letters, you will 
        have to convert each one to a number that represents it, operate 
        on that number, then convert back to a letter. Use this string 
        for the conversions:
    </p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">associations = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 .,:;'\"/\\<>(){}[]-=_+?!"</pre>

    <p>
        To get a character&apos;s numeric representation, find the index of 
        that character in the string (use the code 
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">associations.find(char)</pre> 
        to get the index of char&apos;s first occurrence in associations). 
        To get a character back from this numeric representation, get the 
        character at that number&apos;s index in the string (using 
        associations[index]). For example, the letter &apos;c&apos; would 
        be represented by a 2 because &apos;c&apos; is at index 2 in the 
        string. If you wanted to find which character is represented by 8, 
        you would get the character at index 8, which is &apos;i&apos;.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you can convert characters to numbers and back, you can 
        implement the actual algorithm. It will work by adding each 
        character in the message to its corresponding character in the 
        key (of course, you are actually adding their numerical equivalents). 
        If the message is longer than the key, the key should be repeated to 
        provide more letters to combine. Also, if the sum you get is too 
        high a number to translate back to a character, wrap that number 
        to the beginning of the associations string. For example, using the 
        message &quot;test&quot; and the key &quot;hi&quot; would look 
        like this:
    </p>
    

<pre>  19(t) 04(e) 18(s) 19(t)
+ 07(h) 08(i) 07(h) 08(i)
-----------------------------
= 26(A) 12(m) 25(z) 27(B)
</pre>

    <p>
        Decryption should reverse the process: Given the encrypted message 
        and the original key, it should output the original message. This 
        can simply be done by reversing your algorithm -- that is, 
        subtracting (not adding) from each character in the message its 
        corresponding character in the key.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your progam's output should look like this:
    </p>
    
<pre><code>Enter e to encrypt, d to decrypt, or q to quit: z
Did not understand command, try again.

Enter e to encrypt, d to decrypt, or q to quit: e
Message: Two plus two = Five
Key: Lorem ipsum
+KF;B(CH=NIZ}m;R\Dt

Enter e to encrypt, d to decrypt, or q to quit: d
Message: +KF;B(CH=NIZ}m;R\Dt
Key: Lorem ipsum
Two plus two = Five

Enter e to encrypt, d to decrypt, or q to quit: q
Goodbye!
</code></pre>
