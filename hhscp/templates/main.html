        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Computer Programming is a one-semester course that will introduce the basic techniques of computer
            programming using the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> programming language. Python is a modern,
            interpreted
            language that is relatively easy to learn, while possessing an astonishing depth and flexibility that make it
            suitable
            for sophisticated applications in business, arts, entertainment, science and engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first few weeks of this class you will learn the tools and basic skills needed to write
            simple programs in Python. Each week will develop several new skills or techniques that may be required to
            complete a series of challenge assignments. Some of the skills you will learn during this period include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interactive mode: expressions, types, variables, collections, dir(), help()</li>
            <li>Console I/O</li>
            <li>Lambda functions</li>
            <li>List comprehensions</li>
            <li>Objects, properties, methods and inheritance</li>
            <li>Conditionals and control flow statements</li>
            <li>Functions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Later in the course you will plan and execute a series of one to two-week long mini-projects
        </p>

        <h2>I Provide You With:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Computers with Internet access.</li>
            <li>Python 2.6</li>
            <li>Python Integrated Development Environment: <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> version control</li>
            <li><a href="http://pygame.org">Pygame</a> Python game development library.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>If you want to work outside of class:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We will be using Python 2.6 during this course. This is <em>not</em> the latest version that
                you will find available for download. You can probably use version 2.7, but do not install
                version 3.0!</li>
            <li>A USB Flash drive may come in handy for transferring files.</li>
            <li>
                You may install the latest version of the PyCharm
                Python IDE on your personal computer. We have a
                <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/hanovernorwichschools.org/dennison/computer-programming/pycharm-license">
                    classroom license</a> that entitles you to install and
                use PyCharm at home while you are enrolled in the course.
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> and Pygame will be used later in the course, but are
                not required initially.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>I Expect YOU To:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Come to class.</li>
            <li>Be on time. Please let me know if you expect to be late.</li>
            <li>
                Be responsible. If you are absent on a day when work is due I will expect you to have
                it ready the day you return. If you know you will not be able to take a test or quiz at
                the scheduled time make arrangements with me (by e-mail, in person, etc.) and receive
                confirmation before the scheduled class.
            </li>
            <li>Always treat others with kindness and respect.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Textbook</h2>
        <p>
            There isn't one. I will have a couple of reference books on hand during class, but the best sources
            are always on the Internet. I expect you to use the Internet as a tool for solving problems and
            learning new techniques.
        </p>

        <h2>X Periods</h2>
        <p>
            This class has an X period on Thursday. Please check in at the start of class (or make
            arrangements with me in advance). I do take and submit attendance for the X! The X is available
            to you for finishing your work, getting help or completing missed quizzes.
        </p>

                    At the beginning of the semester, each week will bring a series of challenge assignments that you
                    must complete and upload to a web site. Challenges must typically be completed
                    on Friday.  Scoring rubric:
                    <ul>
                        <li>0/10 - Not submitted</li>
                        <li>4/10 - Submitted, but does not run without errors.</li>
                        <li>6/10 - Submitted, runs without error, but does not meet objectives.</li>

                    Every two weeks or so, you will be quizzed on some of the techniques used in the
                    challenge assignments. Quizzes will usually consist of creating a short program during
                    class and will be “open Internet”. Each quiz will list several requirements and each requirement
                    is scored as one or two points.

                    Your final project will require planning. You or your team must develop a plan and
                    demonstrate weekly progress towards completion. A well-designed and implemented
                    application represents a substantial amount of work!

                    original due date. <strong>You must inform me by e-mail of updated pages or any time you
                    submit late work, as I have no way of knowing what you want me to look at!</strong>
